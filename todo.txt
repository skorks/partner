short option with value separated by equals
  - value not in quotes

long option with value separated by equals

type is an integer

type is a double

multi value has an item type of integer

multi value has an item type of double

can configure a command
  - can configure options for command


less important or implement later
----------------------------------
value is array
value is hash





* Extract building the options with default values from the options parser


thoughts
---------
the concept of a value source for options and priority for value sources to facilitate injecting config file defaults easily

require 'shellwords'

argv = Shellwords.split('three blind "mice"')

feature list
-------------
- when options is parsed a provided lambda is called and given the parsed value for the option
- when an unexpected options is given, writes an error and exits
- double dash followed by string should be considered a single option
- single dash followed by char should be considered a single option
- single dash followed by string should be considered multiple boolean options
- options that take an argument error unless they are given one
- flags that don't take arguments ignore them
- flags that require arguments of a given type, refuse arguments of other types
- flags that have a default value, can derive a type from that value
- type and default value must match
- short names can be derived automatically unless given
- two args can't have the same short
- two args can't have the same long
- switches can be negated with --no-
- double dash ends options processing
- options can be specified multiple times if they are a list option
- boolean options can not be list types
- when long names are auto generated they convert underscores to dashes
- options can be marked as conflicting and can't be specified together
- options can be marked as dependent and must be specified together
- options can be marked as required and must be provided
- argument values can have spaces if wrapped in quotes single or double
- argument value can be separated from switch using space or using = without spaces
